For my first attempt at an [ImpactJS](http://impactjs.com/) game, I took the path of the walking dead with
the help of this glorious [book](https://www.google.com/search?q=Inspired+by+%E2%80%9CIntroducing+HTML5+Game+Development+by+Jesse+Freeman+(O%E2%80%99Reilly).+Copyright+2012+Game+Cook%2C+Inc.%2C+978-1-4493-1517-7.%E2%80%9D&oq=Inspired+by+%E2%80%9CIntroducing+HTML5+Game+Development+by+Jesse+Freeman+(O%E2%80%99Reilly).+Copyright+2012+Game+Cook%2C+Inc.%2C+978-1-4493-1517-7.%E2%80%9D&aqs=chrome..69i57.265j0j7&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=119&ie=UTF-8#q=Introducing+HTML5+Game+Development+by+Jesse+Freeman+).

Overall I'm impressed with and extremely excited about Impact. The feeling of finally unveiling what used to seem like total wizardry (and still usually does) has tremendously deepened my respect for games. I'm looking forward to including more involved posts as I implement features not covered in Freeman's book. So far I've added two additional levels as well as the
ability to pick up extra lives.

Next steps: make some improved zombies with basic AI and include some storyline. More details soon.
