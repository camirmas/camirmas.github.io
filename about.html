<p>I am a Full Stack Developer in training at <a href="http://www.galvanize.it/school/">gSchool</a>. I graduated from UC Berkeley in May 2014 with a B.S. in Environmental Economics and Policy. My main interests include Entrepreneurship, Cleantech, and Sustainability. When I'm not coding weird, fun, and occasionally useful web apps, I'm making snowboard trips to Tahoe and surf trips to Santa Cruz and my home breaks in Ventura and Malibu. I'm a semi-avid traveler and tireless learner, and am excited to improve my skills as a developer and creator.</p>
